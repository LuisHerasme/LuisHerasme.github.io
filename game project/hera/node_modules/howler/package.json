  "readme": "[![howler.js](https://s3.amazonaws.com/howler.js/howler-logo.png \"howler.js\")](https://howlerjs.com)\n\n# Description\n[howler.js](https://howlerjs.com) is an audio library for the modern web. It defaults to [Web Audio API](http://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/) and falls back to [HTML5 Audio](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/embedded-content.html#the-audio-element). This makes working with audio in JavaScript easy and reliable across all platforms.\n\nAdditional information, live demos and a user showcase are available at [howlerjs.com](https://howlerjs.com).\n\n### Features\n* Single API for all audio needs\n* Defaults to Web Audio API and falls back to HTML5 Audio\n* Handles edge cases and bugs across environments\n* Supports all codecs for full cross-browser support\n* Automatic caching for improved performance\n* Control sounds individually, in groups or globally\n* Playback of multiple sounds at once\n* Easy sound sprite definition and playback\n* Full control for fading, rate, seek, volume, etc.\n* Easily add 3D spatial sound or stereo panning\n* Modular - use what you want and easy to extend\n* No outside dependencies, just pure JavaScript\n* As light as 7kb gzipped\n\n### Browser Compatibility\nTested in the following browsers/versions:\n* Google Chrome 7.0+\n* Internet Explorer 9.0+\n* Firefox 4.0+\n* Safari 5.1.4+\n* Mobile Safari 6.0+ (after user input)\n* Opera 12.0+\n* Microsoft Edge\n\n### Live Demos\n* [Audio Player](https://howlerjs.com/#player)\n* [Radio](https://howlerjs.com/#radio)\n* [Spatial Audio](https://howlerjs.com/#spatial)\n* [Audio Sprites](https://howlerjs.com/#sprite)\n\n# Documentation\n\n### Contents\n* [Quick Start](#quick-start)\n* [Examples](#examples)\n* [Core](#core)\n  * [Options](#options)\n  * [Methods](#methods)\n  * [Global Options](#global-options)\n  * [Global Methods](#global-methods)\n* [Plugin: Spatial](#plugin-spatial)\n  * [Options](#options-1)\n  * [Methods](#methods-1)\n  * [Global Methods](#global-methods-1)\n* [Mobile Playback](#mobile-playback)\n* [Dolby Audio Playback](#dolby-audio-playback)\n* [Format Recommendations](#format-recommendations)\n* [License](#license)\n\n### Quick Start\n\nSeveral options to get up and running:\n\n* Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/goldfire/howler.js.git`\n* Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/howler): `npm install howler`\n* Install with [Bower](http://bower.io/): `bower install howler`\n* Hosted CDN: [`cdnjs`](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/howler) [`jsDelivr`](https://www.jsdelivr.com/projects/howler.js)\n\nIn the browser:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"/path/to/howler.js\"></script>\n<script>\n    var sound = new Howl({\n      src: ['sound.webm', 'sound.mp3']\n    });\n</script>\n```\n\n### Examples\n\n##### Most basic, play an MP3:\n```javascript\nvar sound = new Howl({\n  src: ['sound.mp3']\n});\n\nsound.play();\n```\n\n##### More playback options:\n```javascript\nvar sound = new Howl({\n  src: ['sound.webm', 'sound.mp3', 'sound.wav'],\n  autoplay: true,\n  loop: true,\n  volume: 0.5,\n  onend: function() {\n    console.log('Finished!');\n  }\n});\n```\n\n##### Define and play a sound sprite:\n```javascript\nvar sound = new Howl({\n  src: ['sounds.webm', 'sounds.mp3'],\n  sprite: {\n    blast: [0, 3000],\n    laser: [4000, 1000],\n    winner: [6000, 5000]\n  }\n});\n\n// Shoot the laser!\nsound.play('laser');\n```\n\n##### Listen for events:\n```javascript\nvar sound = new Howl({\n  src: ['sound.webm', 'sound.mp3']\n});\n\n// Clear listener after first call.\nsound.once('load', function(){\n  sound.play();\n});\n\n// Fires when the sound finishes playing.\nsound.on('end', function(){\n  console.log('Finished!');\n});\n```\n\n##### Control multiple sounds:\n```javascript\nvar sound = new Howl({\n  src: ['sound.webm', 'sound.mp3']\n});\n\n// Play returns a uniqe Sound ID that can be passed\n// into any method on Howl to control that specific sound.\nvar id1 = sound.play();\nvar id2 = sound.play();\n\n// Fade out the first sound and speed up the second.\nsound.fade(1, 0, 1000, id1);\nsound.rate(1.5, id2);\n```\n\nMore in-depth examples (with accompanying live demos) can be found in the [examples directory](https://github.com/goldfire/howler.js/tree/master/examples).\n\n\n## Core\n\n### Options\n#### src `Array` `[]` *`required`*\nThe sources to the track(s) to be loaded for the sound (URLs or base64 data URIs). These should be in order of preference, howler.js will automatically load the first one that is compatible with the current browser. If your files have no extensions, you will need to explicitly specify the extension using the `format` property.\n#### volume `Number` `1.0`\nThe volume of the specific track, from `0.0` to `1.0`.\n#### html5 `Boolean` `false`\nSet to `true` to force HTML5 Audio. This should be used for large audio files so that you don't have to wait for the full file to be downloaded and decoded before playing.\n#### loop `Boolean` `false`\nSet to `true` to automatically loop the sound forever.\n#### preload `Boolean` `true`\nAutomatically begin downloading the audio file when the `Howl` is defined.\n#### autoplay `Boolean` `false`\nSet to `true` to automatically start playback when sound is loaded.\n#### mute `Boolean` `false`\nSet to `true` to load the audio muted.\n#### sprite `Object` `{}`\nDefine a sound sprite for the sound. The offset and duration are defined in milliseconds. A third (optional) parameter is available to set a sprite as looping. An easy way to generate compatible sound sprites is with [audiosprite](https://github.com/tonistiigi/audiosprite).\n```javascript\n{\n  key: [offset, duration, (loop)]\n}\n```\n#### rate `Number` `1.0`\nThe rate of playback. 0.5 to 4.0, with 1.0 being normal speed.\n#### pool `Number` `5`\nThe size of the inactive sounds pool. Once sounds are stopped or finish playing, they are marked as ended and ready for cleanup. We keep a pool of these to recycle for improved performance. Generally this doesn't need to be changed. It is important to keep in mind that when a sound is paused, it won't be removed from the pool and will still be considered active so that it can be resumed later.\n#### format `Array` `[]`\nhowler.js automatically detects your file format from the extension, but you may also specify a format in situations where extraction won't work (such as with a SoundCloud stream).\n#### onload `Function`\nFires when the sound is loaded.\n#### onloaderror `Function`\nFires when the sound is unable to load. The first parameter is the ID of the sound (if it exists) and the second is the error message/code.\n#### onplay `Function`\nFires when the sound begins playing. The first parameter is the ID of the sound.\n#### onend `Function`\nFires when the sound finishes playing (if it is looping, it'll fire at the end of each loop). The first parameter is the ID of the sound.\n#### onpause `Function`\nFires when the sound has been paused. The first parameter is the ID of the sound.\n#### onstop `Function`\nFires when the sound has been stopped. The first parameter is the ID of the sound.\n#### onmute `Function`\nFires when the sound has been muted/unmuted. The first parameter is the ID of the sound.\n#### onvolume `Function`\nFires when the sound's volume has changed. The first parameter is the ID of the sound.\n#### onrate `Function`\nFires when the sound's playback rate has changed. The first parameter is the ID of the sound.\n#### onseek `Function`\nFires when the sound has been seeked. The first parameter is the ID of the sound.\n#### onfade `Function`\nFires when the current sound finishes fading in/out. The first parameter is the ID of the sound.\n\n\n### Methods\n#### play([sprite/id])\nBegins playback of a sound. Returns the sound id to be used with other methods. Only method that can't be chained.\n* **sprite/id**: `String/Number` `optional` Takes one parameter that can either be a sprite or sound ID. If a sprite is passed, a new sound will play based on the sprite's definition. If a sound ID is passed, the previously played sound will be played (for example, after pausing it). However, if an ID of a sound that has been drained from the pool is passed, nothing will play.\n\n#### pause([id])\nPauses playback of sound or group, saving the `seek` of playback.\n* **id**: `Number` `optional` The sound ID.

Will return 0 until after the `load` event fires.\n* **id**: `Number` `optional` The sound ID to check. Passing an ID will return the duration of the sprite being played on this instance; otherwise, the full source duration is returned.\n\n#### on(event, function, [id])\nListen for events. Multiple events can be added by calling this multiple times.\n* **event**: `String` Name of event to fire/set (`load`, `loaderror`, `play`, `end`, `pause`, `stop`, `mute`, `volume`, `rate`, `seek`, `fade`).\n* **function**: `Function` Define function to fire on event.\n* **id**: `Number` `optional` Only listen to events for this sound id.\n\n#### once(event, function, [id])\nSame as `on`, but it removes itself after the callback is fired.\n* **event**: `String` Name of event to fire/set (`load`, `loaderror`, `play`, `end`, `pause`, `stop`, `mute`, `volume`, `rate`, `seek`, `fade`).\n* **function**: `Function` Define function to fire on event.\n* **id**: `Number` `optional` Only listen to events for this sound id.\n\n#### off(event, [function], [id])\nRemove event listener that you've set.

This will immediately stop all sounds and remove them from cache.\n\n\n## Plugin: Spatial\n\n### Options\n#### orientation `Array` `[1, 0, 0]`\nSets the direction the audio source is pointing in the 3D cartesian coordinate space. Depending on how direction the sound is, based on the `cone` attributes, a sound pointing away from the listener can be quiet or silent.\n#### stereo `Number` `null`\nSets the stereo panning value of the audio source for this sound or group. This makes it easy to setup left/right panning with a value of `-1.0` being far left and a value of `1.0` being far right.\n#### pos `Array` `null`\nSets the 3D spatial position of the audio source for this sound or group. Setting any value higher than `1.0` will begin to decrease the volume of the sound as it moves further away.\n#### pannerAttr `Object`\nSets the panner node's attributes for a sound or group of sounds. See the `pannerAttr` method for all available options.\n#### onstereo `Function`\nFires when the current sound has the stereo panning changed. The first parameter is the ID of the sound.\n#### onpos `Function`\nFires when the current sound has the listener position changed. The first parameter is the ID of the sound.\n#### onorientation `Function`\nFires when the current sound has the direction of the listener changed. The first parameter is the ID of the sound.\n\n\n### Methods\n#### stereo(pan, [id])\nGet/set the stereo panning of the audio source for this sound or all in the group.\n* **pan**: `Number` A value of `-1.0` is all the way left and `1.0` is all the way right.\n* **id**: `Number` `optional` The sound ID. If none is passed, all in group will be updated.\n\n#### pos(x, y, z, [id])\nGet/set the 3D spatial position of the audio source for this sound or group. Setting any value higher than `1.0` will begin to decrease the volume of the sound as it moves further away.\n* **x**: `Number` The x-position of the audio from `-1000.0` to `1000.0`.\n* **y**: `Number` The y-position of the audio from `-1000.0` to `1000.0`.\n* **z**: `Number` The z-position of the audio from `-1000.0` to `1000.0`.\n* **id**: `Number` `optional` The sound ID. If none is passed, all in group will be updated.\n\n#### orientation(x, y, z, [id])\nGet/set the direction the audio source is pointing in the 3D cartesian coordinate space. Depending on the direction of the sound, based on the `cone` attributes, a sound pointing away from the listener can be quiet or silent.\n* **x**: `Number` The x-orientation of the source.\n* **y**: `Number` The y-orientation of the source.\n* **z**: `Number` The z-orientation of the source.\n* **id**: `Number` `optional` The sound ID. If none is passed, all in group will be updated.\n\n#### pannerAttr(o, [id])\nGet/set the panner node's attributes for a sound or group of sounds. This method can optionall take 0, 1 or 2 arguments.\n* **o**: `Object` All values to update.\n  * **coneInnerAngle** `360` There will be no volume reduction inside this angle.\n  * **coneOuterAngle** `360` The volume will be reduced to a constant value of `coneOuterGain` outside this angle.\n  * **coneOuterGain** `0` The amount of volume reduction outside of `coneOuterAngle`.\n  * **distanceModel** `inverse` Determines algorithm to use to reduce volume as audio moves away from listener. Can be `linear`, `inverse` or `exponential.\n  * **maxDistance** `10000` Volume won't reduce between source/listener beyond this distance.\n  * **panningModel** `HRTF` Determines which spatialization algorithm is used to position audio. Can be `HRTF` or `equalpower`.\n  * **refDistance** `1` A reference distance for reducing volume as the source moves away from the listener.\n  * **rolloffFactor** `1` How quickly the volume reduces as source moves from listener.\n* **id**: `Number` `optional` The sound ID. If none is passed, all in group will be updated.\n\n\n### Global Methods\n#### stereo(pan)\nHelper method to update the stereo panning position of all current `Howls`. Future `Howls` will not use this value unless explicitly set.\n* **pan**: `Number` A value of -1.0 is all the way left and 1.0 is all the way right.\n\n#### pos(x, y, z)\nGet/set the position of the listener in 3D cartesian space. Sounds using 3D position will be relative to the listener's position.\n* **x**: `Number` The x-position of the listener.\n* **y**: `Number` The y-position of the listener.\n* **z**: `Number` The z-position of the listener.\n\n#### orientation(x, y, z, xUp, yUp, zUp)\nGet/set the direction the listener is pointing in the 3D cartesian space. A front and up vector must be provided. The front is the direction the face of the listener is pointing, and up is the direction the top of the listener is pointing. Thus, these values are expected to be at right angles from each other.\n* **x**: `Number` The x-orientation of listener.\n* **y**: `Number` The y-orientation of listener.\n* **z**: `Number` The z-orientation of listener.\n* **xUp**: `Number` The x-orientation of the top of the listener.\n* **yUp**: `Number` The y-orientation of the top of the listener.\n* **zUp**: `Number` The z-orientation of the top of the listener.\n\n\n### Mobile Playback\nBy default, audio on iOS, Android, etc is locked until a sound is played within a user interaction, and then it plays normally the rest of the page session ([Apple documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/safari/documentation/audiovideo/conceptual/using_html5_audio_video/PlayingandSynthesizingSounds/PlayingandSynthesizingSounds.html)). The default behavior of howler.js is to attempt to silently unlock audio playback by playing an empty buffer on the first `touchend` event. This behavior can be disabled by calling:\n\n```javascript\nHowler.mobileAutoEnable = false;\n```\n\n### Dolby Audio Playback\nFull support for playback of the Dolby Audio format (currently support in Edge and Safari) is included. However, you must specify that the file you are loading is `dolby` since it is in a `mp4` container.\n\n```javascript\nvar dolbySound = new Howl({\n  src: ['sound.mp4', 'sound.webm', 'sound.mp3'],\n  format: ['dolby', 'webm', 'mp3']\n});\n```\n\n### Format Recommendations\nHowler.js supports a wide array of audio codecs that have varying browser support (\"mp3\", \"opus\", \"ogg\", \"wav\", \"aac\", \"m4a\", \"mp4\", \"webm\", ...), but if you want full browser coverage you still need to use at least two of them. If your goal is to have the best balance of small filesize and high quality, based on extensive production testing, your best bet is to default to `webm` and fallback to `mp3`. `webm` has nearly full browser coverage with a great combination of compression and quality. You'll need the `mp3` fallback for Internet Explorer.\n\nIt is important to remember that howler.js selects the first compatible sound from your array of sources. So if you want `webm` to be used before `mp3`, you need to put the sources in that order.\n\nIf you want your `webm` files to be seekable in Firefox, be sure to encode them with the cues element. One way to do this is by using the `dash` flag in [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/):\n\n```\nffmpeg -i sound1.wav -dash 1 sound1.webm\n```\n\n### License\n\nCopyright (c) 2013-2017 [James Simpson](https://twitter.com/GoldFireStudios) and [GoldFire Studios, Inc.](http://goldfirestudios.com)\n\nReleased under the [MIT License](https://github.com/goldfire/howler.js/blob/master/LICENSE.md).\n",
